Bug Report (20200619):
It can not support file with relative folder. 
after tracking, found that: in the source code of zip.c Line821, 
     if (!mz_zip_writer_add_file(&zip_archive, base_name(name), name, "", 0,    ......
the second paramater should be replace with the relative path filename, e.g.,  temp\\work.doc
and the third parameter should be replace with the absolute path name. e.g., c:\\mydoc\\temp\\work.doc

for such a folder structure:
              c:\\mydoc\\readme.txt
              c:\\mydoc\\temp\\work.doc
if I want to compress all files(include subfolder) in the folder c:\\mydoc, just transfer the relative pathname
                  readme.txt
                  temp\\work.doc
